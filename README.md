# LCA_with_Python

> **4 Steps for LCA with Python**
> 
> 1. **LCA Project Setup**: Establishes a comprehensive Python-based LCA environment with specialized packages, data handling, and visualization libraries, alongside essential ecoinvent data import for in-depth lifecycle inventory analysis.
> 2. **Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Analysis**: Focuses on selecting and examining specific activities for their environmental impacts, including understanding their exchanges and choosing appropriate LCA methods, supported by the ecoquery database.
> 3. **LCA Execution**: Involves calculating the environmental impact of chosen activities using selected methods, with neatly organized results including impact scores and units.
> 4. **Contribution Analysis & Visualization**: Delves into the supply chain to assess and visualize contributions at different levels, facilitating a clear understanding of the relative environmental impacts in the LCA study.
